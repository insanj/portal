### Step One: Obtaining a Portal Gun

The actual Portal Gun item is a Nether Star with the destination coordinates displayed below the name. To make one, either issue the command `/portalgun` as an operator, or craft it with:

### Step Two: Fueling the Portal Gun

For a Portal Gun to work, it will use up 1 Ender Pearl from the inventory of the player who opened up the portal.

### Step Three: Setting the Portal Gun destination

Right click anywhere with the Portal Gun in your hand to open the GUI. The x coordinate goes on the first row, the y coordinate goes on the 2nd row and the z coordinate goes on the 3rd row.

Optionally, you can enter the name of the world on the 4th row, in case your server has more than one world, or you'd like to go to the Nether or The End. Make sure to use the name of the save file (ex: `world_nether`, and not the UUID or display name).

### Step Four: Opening up a portal

Once you have set the destination of your Portal Gun, left click anywhere to open up a portal! The portal will immediately appear as green "Happy Villager" particles. 

Unlike Nether Portals or End Portals, the Portal Gun openings only last for **five seconds**. Hurry up and jump through, before it closes, to instantly be teleported to the destination programmed into your Portal Gun!

### Step Five: 🎉 Have fun

Store as many Portal Guns as you want in your inventory. Each one will stay linked to its destination forever, so you can grab whichever you need for the adventure at end!
