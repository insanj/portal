Based off of the [Bukkit reqest forum post](https://bukkit.org/threads/portal-gun.478108/) made by user [Shikishima](https://bukkit.org/members/shikishima.91268249/). Forked and rewritten from [MrDaniel's PortalGun](https://github.com/MrDaniel-TX/PortalGun), which is also why he is included in the Authors section.
